Game name: you vs tanks

Game Overview: The game is a virtual game. In this game, players fight against tanks. I think the combination of left and right hands is a very interesting design idea, so I designed the player to need both hands to do different actions in order to control the game character. The player's left hand needs to hold the controller as in the game screen to throw out in order to make the game character attack, and the right hand needs to use the keyboard to control the movement of the game character. When the player defeats all tanks, the player wins. When a player is defeated by a tank, the player loses the game.
The game uses Unity to develop a 3D environment and compile the code, while using Arduino to control the hardware.

Future development and thinking:
I think there is still a lot of room for improvement in this project in the future.
For example, in the design of the sensor, I think it is possible to fix the ultrasonic sensor on an axe. (In the game, the characters throw axes to attack, so I think it would be better if the player could hold the same weapon as the character.) The attack can be done by the player swinging an axe at the ground. When the axe is near the ground, the game character can throw the axe to attack.
From a game design perspective, I think we should make more levels and make the game more difficult. The current game is still a relatively simple confrontation game. But in the future I think we can add items or make this game multiplayer and so on. There is much more to think about.
In the future, it may be possible to make a relatively complete view of time for this game, so that the game becomes more rich and complete. It could be an adventure game and so on.
There's still a lot to improve on, but at the same time I learned a lot from the game, I learned a lot about the code and unity, including arduino connectivity and so on. These really need to be gradually improved and learned in practice. There's still a long way to go, but being the first person to make a game, it definitely got me started. I believe that the experience brought by this game will make me learn better in the future.
